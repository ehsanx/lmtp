> Non-parametric Causal Effects of Feasible Interventions Based on Modified Treatment Policies

Nick Williams and Ivan Diaz

---

**lmtp** is an R package that provides an estimation framework for the casual effects of feasible interventions based on point-treatment and longitudinal modified treatment policies as described in Diaz, Williams, Hoffman, and Schenck (2020). Two primary estimators are supported, a targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator and a sequentially doubly robust (SDR) estimator (a G-computation and an inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator are provided for the sake of being thorough but their use is recommended against in favor of the TML and SDR estimators). Both binary and continuous outcomes (both with censoring) are allowed. **lmtp** is built atop the [`SuperLearner`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SuperLearner) package to utilize ensemble machine learning for estimation. The treatment mechanism is estimated via a density ratio classification procedure irrespective of treatment variable type providing decreased computation time when treatment is continuous. Dynamic treatment regimes are also supported. 

For an in-depth look at the package's functionality, please consult the accompanying [article]().

## Installation

**lmtp** can be installed from CRAN with: 

```r
install.packages("lmtp")
```

The stable, development version can be installed from GitHub with: 

```r
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/lmtp@devel")
```

## What even is a modified treatment policy? 

Modified treatment policies (MTP) are interventions that can depend on the *natural* value of the treatment (the treatment value in the absence of intervention). A key assumption for causal inference is the *positivity assumption* which states that all observations have a non-zero probability of experiencing a treatment value. **When working with continuous or multivalued treatments, violations of the positivity assumption are likely to occur. MTPs offer a solution to this problem.** 

## Can lmtp estimation other effects? 

Yes! **lmtp** can estimate the effects of deterministic, static treatment effects (such as the ATE) and deterministic, dynamic treatment regimes for binary, continuous, and survival outcomes.

## Example

```{r}
library(lmtp)

# the data: 4 treatment nodes with time varying covariates and a binary outcome
head(sim_t4)
```

We're interested in a treatment policy, `d`, where exposure is decreased by 1 only among subjects whose exposure won't go below 1 if intervened upon. The true population outcome under this policy is about 0.305.

```{r}
# our treatment policy function to be applied at all time points
policy <- function(data, trt) {
  (data[[trt]] - 1) * (data[[trt]] - 1 >= 1) + data[[trt]] * (data[[trt]] - 1 < 1)
}
```

In addition to specifying a treatment policy, we need to specify our treatment variables and time-varying covariates.

```{r}
# our treatment nodes, a character vector of length 4
a <- c("A_1", "A_2", "A_3", "A_4")
# our time varying nodes, a list of length 4
time_varying <- list(c("L_1"), c("L_2"), c("L_3"), c("L_4"))
```

We can now estimate the effect of our treatment policy, `d`. In this example, we'll use the cross-validated TML estimator with 10 folds. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lmtp_tmle(sim_t4, a, "Y", time_vary = time_varying, k = 0, shift = policy, folds = 10)
#> LMTP Estimator: TMLE
#>    Trt. Policy: (policy)
#> 
#> Population intervention effect
#>       Estimate: 0.2598
#>     Std. error: 0.0188
#>         95% CI: (0.2228, 0.2967)
```

## Similar Implementations

A variety of other R packages perform similar tasks as **lmtp**. However, **lmtp** is the only R package currently capable of estimating causal effects for binary, categorical, and continuous exposures in both the point treatment and longitudinal setting using traditional causal effects or modified treatment policies.
